A list of some of my favorite recipes of all time!!
I am just a programmer with a dream to become a chef!! I have a passion for cooking and love to explore new recipes. I am a sucker for sweets, I love cookies, ice-cream and especially French macaroons!!! 

I hope you enjoy these recipes as much as I do!!
